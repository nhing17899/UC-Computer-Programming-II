The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf.
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim.
The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack!
